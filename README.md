## Capstone Project

This project was developed under the scope of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)  by [DataTalks](https://datatalks.club/).

My [homeworks repository](https://github.com/maxim-panchishin/zoomcamp2023) for theoretical part.

## Problem

There were numerous issues with Dutch airports last summer due to a surge in passenger traffic, which returned to pre-pandemic levels. The airports were not prepared to process such a high volume of people. In this project, I aim to determine which Dutch airport is better to use for travel.

Research questions:

- Which airports offer which routes to which countries, and how many of them? Which airport is better for each route?
- Which airlines are more popular at each airport?
- TBD

## Datasets

- [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) -  Airports, Airlines, Routes, Countries
- [CBS Open data Statline](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=en&_catalog=CBS&tableId=37478eng&_theme=1170) - Monthly figures of Dutch airports
- **TBD**: [FlightLookup](https://flightlookup.com/)
